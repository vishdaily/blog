# Notebooks

Here are some open source note books,Â  that i came across recently. Just open it in browser and add notes also doesn&#8217;t require any database or using in-built database.

  * [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)
  * [Noteself](https://noteself.github.io/)
  * [Docuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki)
  * [Orgmode](http://orgmode.org/features.html)

From the first look this orgmode is more for the users who doesn&#8217;t want to use mouse or trackpad much.
