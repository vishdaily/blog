At this moment, If I think, my daily routine drills down to &#8216;Computers&#8217; and &#8216;The Rest&#8217;. (I already have a feeling, that others are already feeling sorry for me. please don&#8217;t ðŸ™‚ )

Most of my posts go in to Computers because, as part of my job and hobby, I really enjoy coding, learning new programming languages. Well, since I am not a robot, there is also other aspect to my life, which is very important other than Computers. I would call it &#8220;The Rest&#8221; => &#8220;Life&#8221;. Family, Being Close To Nature, Biking, Photography are major aspects that I cherish other than Computers.

It&#8217;s always easy to post something in to Computers section because, mostly, the posts are referring to a Problem and a possible Solution, that works for every one. I don&#8217;t want to get in to the performance details here.

But, &#8216;The Rest&#8217;, hmm, its hard for me to describe any life experience, problems and emotions in terms of words. Yeah sure, there are great authors and poets who could do that. I am not. I would be writing a book otherwise :). What make sense from my perspective could be completely senseless from other peoples perspective. After all, every one has their own life and I believe that their reasoning comes from their experiences. So at the end, understanding the fact that, It is hard to satisfy all, I still try to post something here If it really make sense. But, well its my own blog, i can write what ever I want, and by disabling the comments, making it a one way road ðŸ™‚ .
