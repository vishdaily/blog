# About

This is it! Finally I am excited that i am starting my private blog. Every time i get stuck at some task and find a solution or got to know new information, i used to note it down in various places. When i need it again, i had to look in 100 places for that. I always wanted to organise all the information in a single place but couldnâ€™t have time (just an excuse ? ). 

Today i was again searching all those places and digging through my browser history regarding the issue (linux ssh related). Having vexed with this, today, I decided to give at least a kick start to my blog. And here it is! 

I try to post all my experiences, ideas, struggles, opinions and various information which i think is useful to my self and also to public.

Any opinions or thoughts i post here are purely based on my experience and do not intend to hurt any others feelings in any way.
